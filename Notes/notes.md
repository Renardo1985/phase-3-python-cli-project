Welcome to the end of Phase 3! You've learned about a lot in this unit:

Python fundamentals.
Data structures (and more recently, algorithms).
Object-oriented programming.
Object inheritance.
Class attributes and methods.
Configuring applications.
SQL fundamentals.
Table relations in SQL.
Object-relational mapping with Python.
Object-relational mapping with SQLAlchemy.
Building CLIs.

### In this project, we're going to use these skills to create a CLI. You won't be able to fit everything in from phase 3, but the following are the minimum requirements:

A CLI application that solves a real-world problem and adheres to best practices.
A database created and modified with SQLAlchemy ORM with 2+ related tables.
A well-maintained virtual environment using Pipenv.
Proper package structure in your application.
Use of lists and dicts.

### Consider these stretch goals as you progress through your project:

A database created and modified with SQLAlchemy ORM with 3+ related tables.
Use of many-to-many relationships with SQLAlchemy ORM.
Use of additional data structures, such as ranges and tuples.
A rubric for this project is available on the next page in this Canvas module. Make sure to take a look before you get started!
